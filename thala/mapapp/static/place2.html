As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't specific information available about a cinema chain or entity named "Blue Cinemas" that I can provide. It's possible that "Blue Cinemas" might be a local cinema chain, a newly established entity, or one that hasn't gained widespread recognition or documentation in sources available up to my last update.

If "Blue Cinemas" is a newly established cinema chain or one that gained prominence after my last update, I would recommend searching for more recent information online, checking local directories, or visiting their official website or social media pages for details about their locations, offerings, and other relevant information.
