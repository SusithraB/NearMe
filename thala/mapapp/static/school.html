As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't specific information available about a school named "Sree Jayam School" that I can provide. It's possible that this school might be a local institution or one that hasn't gained widespread recognition or documentation in sources available up to my last update.

If "Sree Jayam School" is a newly established institution or one that gained prominence after my last update, I would recommend searching for more recent information online or through local directories and educational authorities in the relevant region.
